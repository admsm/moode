<h4>General</h4>
<p>There are four main sections to moOde: Playback, Library, CoverView and Configuration.</p>
<p>Switching between Playback and the Library is accomplished by tapping on the cover art in Playback or on any open area of the Playbar in the Library.</p>

<h4>Playback</h4>
<p>The Playback screen includes the play queue (Queue), volume and time knobs, playback controls, cover art and metadata.

<h4>Library</h4>
<p>The library provides Radio, Folder, Tag, Album and Playlist views for browsing and selecting content and a Playbar for displaying song information and controlling playback. Options for configuring various aspects of the Library including sort order, recently added and more are located in the Library section of the Preferences dialog.</p>
<h4>Searching the Library</h4>
<p>Powerful search features are available in Tag and Album view that allow the Library to be filtered based on entered text, tag value pairs or special, predefined filters. These are entered in the search field on the Library menu. There is also an Advanced search dialog that enables multiple tag value pairs to be submitted.</p>
<div id="quickhelp-bullet-list">
	<ul>
		<li><span> General</span>
			<p>Searches are not case sensitive and partial matches are considered valid. Searches are cleared by tapping on the "Filtered by" heading.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Tag value pairs</span>
			<p>The following tags are supported: Any, Genre, Artist, Album, Title, Album Artist, Date, Composer, Conductor, Performer, Work, Comment and File.</p>
			<p>Examples: genre rock | artist frank sinatra | artist mccartney | any zeppelin</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> The Any tag</span>
			<p>The Any tag performs a search of all tags using an OR relationship. An Any search is automatically invoked when the first word of text entered in the search field does not match any of the tag or predefined filter names.</p>
			<p>Examples: yellow submarine | all that you can't leave behind | frank sinatra | 1962</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Predefined filters</span>
			<p>The following predefined filters are available: Encoded [bits/rate], Format [.ext], Folder [path], Hdonly, Lossless, Lossy and Year [yyyy] or [yyyy-yyyy].</p>
			<p>Examples: encoded 24/96 | encoded 192 | hdonly | format .dsf | folder u2/achtung baby | lossy | year 1962 | year 1994-1998</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h4>CoverView</h4>
<p>The CoverView screen saver provides a large sized cover art image, a Playbar for controlling playback and several backdrop Options that can be selected in the CoverView section of the Preferences dialog.</p>

<h4>Configuration</h4>
<p>The Configuration screens are accessed via the Main Menu and provide settings for the Library, Audio, Network and System.</p>

<h4>Queue</h4>
<p>The Queue is displayed in Playback and CoverView and contains all items to be played. It's populated primarily by selecting an item from the Library and then tapping one of the Queue commands listed on a context menu. It can also be populated automatically by Auto-shuffle. The Queue commands are listed below.</p>
<div id="quickhelp-bullet-list">
	<ul>
		<li><span> Add | Play</span>
			<p>The "Add" command adds the item to the end of the Queue. The "Play" command first checks to see if the item is already in the Queue and then plays the existing item otherwise it does the same as Add and then begins play.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Clear/Play</span>
			<p>The "Clear/Play" command first clears the Queue then adds the item and begins play.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Add next | Play next</span>
			<p>The "Add next" command adds the item immediately after the currently playing or last played item. The "Play next" command first checks to see if the item is already in the Queue and then plays the existing item otherwise it does the same as "Add next" then begins play.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>For the track list in Library Tag and Album views the Play and Clear/Play actions can be configured via a Preferences option to either add the selected track to the Queue or the selected track and all following tracks.</p>
		</li
	</ul>
</div>

<h4>Playlists</h4>
<p> Creating, editing and managing playlists is done primarily in Library Playlist view. Playlists can also be created via context menu items "Save Queue to playlist", "Set Favorites name" and "Add to playlist".</p>
<div id="quickhelp-bullet-list">
	<ul>
		<li><span> Save Queue to playlist</span>
			<p>The "Save Queue to playlist" command displays a list of available playlists and adds the item to the end of the selected playlist or a new playlist if one is specified.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Set Favorites name</span>
			<p>The "Set Favorites name" command displays an input form for specifying the name of the playlist that contains items favorited by clicking the Heart <i class="far fa-heart"></i> button. If the playlist does not already exist it will be created.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Add to playlist</span>
			<p>The "Add to playlist" command displays a list of available playlists and adds the item to the end of the selected playlist or a new playlist if one is specified.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h4>Multiroom audio</h4>
<p>A moOde multiroom audio system consists of a Sender and Receivers. The Sender should be a dedicated moOde player configured to output to the integrated HDMI port or optioally the Headphone jack but not connected to any speakers or headphones. It functions solely as a Music Server that Sends its audio output to one or more Receivers. For additional information <a href="./setup_multiroom.txt" class="multiroom-setup-link" target="_blank">View multiroom setup guide</a></p>
<div id="quickhelp-bullet-list">
	<ul>
		<li><span> Configuration</span>
			<p>Sender and Receiver options are configured in Multiroom Config which is accessed via Menu/Configure or in the ALSA section of Audio Config. Audio sources including MPD, Airplay and Spotify can be distributed by the Sender.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Master volume</span>
			<p>The volume knob on the Sender system provides master volume control by sending the volume change to the Receivers which apply it to their own volume. Receivers can be configured to opt in or out of Master volume control via Multiroom Config.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Receiver control</span>
			<p>Receivers can be centrally controlled from the Sender system via the Receivers panel which is accessed by the&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-rss"></i>&nbsp;button at the top of Playback view.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Networking</span>
			<p>The performance of the system depends on having low latency, high throughput networking and hosts. Discovery of Receivers relies on Multicast DNS. Addressing for the audio distribution protocol relies on IP Multicast using a default address of 239.0.0.1.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Audio format</span>
			<p>The system uses 16 bit 48 kHz PCM format encoded using the Opus CODEC. Resampling if needed is handled by ALSA using the Speex converter.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
